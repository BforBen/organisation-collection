A collection of data about Local Planning Authorities and other organisations who publish data used by digital land:

* [collection/organisations.csv](collection/organisations.csv)

The data is assembled from the following authoritative sources:

* [government-organisation](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/registers/government-organisation)
* [local-authority-eng](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/registers/local-authority-eng)

and combined with the following datasets, to be replaced with more authoritative sources, where possible:

* [data/development-corporation.csv](data/development-corporation.csv) -- a list of development corporations
* [data/website.csv](data/website.csv) -- websites for local authorities, national parks and development corporations
* [data/statistical-geography.csv](data/gss.csv) -- mapping of organisations to their GSS statistical-geography code
