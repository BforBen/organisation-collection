A collection of data about Local Planning Authorities and other organisations who publish data used by digital land:

* [collection/organisations.csv](collection/organisations.csv)

The list of organisations is assembled from the following registers:

* [government-organisation](https://government-organisation.register.gov.uk)
* [local-authority-eng](https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

and combined with the following registers to provide statistical geographies:

* [statistical-geography-county-eng](https://statistical-geography-county-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-london-borough-eng](https://statistical-geography-london-borough-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng](https://statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

This locally maintained dataset adds websites for local authorities, and development corporations not yet listed on GOV.UK:
